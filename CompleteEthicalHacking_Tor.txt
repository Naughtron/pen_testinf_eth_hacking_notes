PenTesting / Ethical Hacking Notes: 

- TOPIC: Tor, proxy, and vpns aka: awesome ways to avoid firewall rules! 

To install Tor: 
1. get Tor: apt-get install tor -y
2. create a new user: adduser username
3. login as that user - DO NOT GO ONLINE AS ROOT unless you know exactly what you are doing.
4. Get Tor from here: https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en
 The way tor works: 
 - Tor connects to varrious torn network nodes and your actual request comes from the exit node. 
 You are using multiple proxy. You can also "Torify" application connections. Heads up this is SLOW.
