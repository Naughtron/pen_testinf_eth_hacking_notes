PenTesting / Ethical Hacking Notes: 

- TOPIC: Proxy Chains. Cover your footprints. 

1. Modify your proxychains.config file
nano /etc/proxychains.conf

2. Types you can use: 
HTTP, SOCKS4, SOCKS5 tunneling proxifier with DNS.
- SOCKS5 is the best option [supports IPv6 and UDP unlike 4]

3. Options: 

dynamic_chain - this is the most common option. it is the most stable. As long as a one proxy in your chain is functional it will work, and there is no specific order to the connection chain.

random_chain - each connection is done with a new proxy

proxy_dns - this will hide you local ISP DNS requesting address. 

4. Example Proxy Setting: 
socks5  192.168.67.78   1080    lamer      secret
TYPE    ADDRESS         PORT    Username   Password

5. You can check is Tor is running with: 
service tor status

6. You can start Tor with: 
service tor start

7. Verify setup:
proxychains firefox www.duckduckgo.com

Verification: 
- Validate that you got to the site
- Validate 
|D-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:9050-<><>-x.x.x.x:53-<><>-OK
|DNS-response| safebrowsing-cache.google.com is xxx.xx.xxx.xx
- Go to https://www.dnsleaktest.com/ and check that the location is "wrong"
In my case: 
Hello 199.249.223.68
from San Angelo, United States

8. Route nmap traffic through a Proxy Chain
proxychains nmap ip port args....
proxychains firefox

YOU CAN DO THIS WITH LOTS OF APPLICATIONS! 

9. See if you can find free socks5 proxy's
http://www.socks-proxy.net/ <-- just be careful
countrys to "trust":

China
Russia
Germany

You would add the additional proxy just like above. Just add a lot, because not all of them are going to work. 
Remember to close your borwser whenever you make changes else will not take effect.

Keep this list low, as you are going to route through them, and if you have a massive list then you are going to have to wait for lots of timeouts.
