PenTesting / Ethical Hacking Notes: 

- TOPIC: VPNs

1. change your DNS settings

2. view your current dns settings
/etc/ cat resolv.conf 

3. edit your dhclient.conf
nano /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf

4. look for #prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1; and un-comment it. 
This is where you are going to add new name servers. 
https://www.opendns.com/ 
208.67.222.222
208.67.220.220

Now looks like: 
prepend domain-name-servers 208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220;

5. bounce the network config after making your changes: 
service network-manager restart

6. check that the changes took effect: 
cat resolv.conf
nameserver 208.67.222.222
nameserver 208.67.220.220
nameserver 192.168.0.1

6a. PROTIP. If you never want your own dns to be used go back into the dhclient.conf file and add a third address. this will bump yours out of the resolv.conf. See if you can find one in the netherlands. https://db-ip.com/all/208.69.35


example:
nameserver 208.67.222.222 <- openDNS
nameserver 208.67.220.220 <- openDNS
nameserver 8.8.8.8 <- Google

DONT FORGET TO RESTART THE NETWORK MANAGER

7. Open a browser on the kali box and type in "about:config". Click ok at the warning.

8. Search for media.peerconnection.enable, double click the Value, so it is "false". Close the browser.
