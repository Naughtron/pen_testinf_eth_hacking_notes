PenTesting / Ethical Hacking Notes: 

- TOPIC: MAC Addrs

1. you can see you MAC with: 
ifconfig, then just look for HWaddr

- First 3 sets of the address are the hardware maker 
- Last 3 sets are used by the maker 

2. this address WILL NOT leave the local network / default gateway

3. we can change it with: 
macchanger 

4. show a device: 
macchanger --s eth0 <-- example

5. assign a random MAC addr with -r:
macchanger -r eth0

result: 
New MAC:       1e:fc:e8:51:50:8b (unknown) <-- or something else random

6. reset things with -p
macchanger -p eth0

7. find all known vendor with -l

8. you can set the address with -m! You could set your address to a victim :) 

9. you can run this as a cron job as well: 
a. crontab -e
b. pick and editor
c. @reboot macchanger -r eth0 

script version: 
#!/bin/bash

ifconfig eth0 down
sleep 2 
macchanger -r eth0
sleep 2
ifconfig eth0 up
